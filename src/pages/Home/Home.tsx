    <p>Hello and welcome,</p>
    <p>
      I go by the nicknames of <i>Ucat</i> and <i>Fon</i> and i've been building
      this tool on my spare time. You can contact me using discord, my handle is
      Fon#2880
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Json viewer</b> is where you can download the raw files i use on this
      tool to check raw data or to create your own tool.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>All items</b> is where you can find all items on the game as well as
      their recipes. It also allows you to input item prices and uses the recipe
      data to help you calculate your price for items. I got this data using
      the&nbsp;
      <a href="https://github.com/ZeelNightwolf/EcoDataExporter">
        EcoDataExporter
      </a>
      &nbsp;plugin.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is very much a work in progress and more sections should be added
      later.
    </p>
    <p>So stay tuned. And i hope you enjoy it</p>
